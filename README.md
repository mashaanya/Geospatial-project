ðŸš€ Project Overview

Japan is experiencing rapid urbanization, particularly in cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama. This project aims to analyze how urban expansion affects protected areas, water bodies, and forest cover loss over time. By integrating remote sensing, GIS, and spatial analysis, we can identify risk zones where urban growth threatens natural ecosystems.

ðŸš€ Urban Planning: Helps policymakers control sprawl & land use policies.
ðŸŒ± Environmental Conservation: Identifies where protected areas are at risk.
ðŸ’§ Water Management: Detects changes in freshwater resources due to urbanization.
ðŸŒ³ Forestry Protection: Tracks deforestation trends linked to infrastructure expansion.

what could be done?
-city specific analysis (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto)
-calculate distances between urban raster or forest loss one to Roads, populated places like we did in PS3
